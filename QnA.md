# QnA

### planning:

> What do you think are the greatest risk areas in completing the project?

- Choosing the optimal tools and overall coding styles concerning questions such as how to style React components, whether to use an existing React component libraries like [material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui), which popular organizational style to pick for structuring the React application and whether to utilize a state management library. There is a tremendous amount of risks involved in making this kind of decisions for this project because it is time-sensitive to the hourly level and hence any ambiguity or irregularity in any tool can potentially derail the whole project with the addition damage of making the development process a lot more stressful.

- In my experience, even simple-looking UIs can have hidden CSS challenges because CSS has a lot of arbitrary rules and hence is an extremely unpredictable language. The time-sensitive nature of this project further compounds the level of risk that goes into making every single CSS decision, especially those that concern layouts and affect child elements. Moreover, some styles in the mockups may be difficult to implement and therefore require difficult compromises which could be detrimental to the aesthetic quality of the end product.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- Only allowing pasting at the search bar might be too limiting although it does cover most of the use cases. Hence, I would recommend accommodating typing at the input field by explicitly including a button to submit the search. Furthermore, once the user arrives at the issue list page, I would allow the link label to transform into an input field and a submit button by clicking on it so that the user can change the link more easily. However, to integrate this change, I think we should change the design of the label to look more clickable.

- I believe it is reasonable to allow an user to click on each GitHub issue and go to the issue page because it is likely that this is the ultimate goal of an user going to a GitHub issue viewer. To elaborate further, I would imagine that most users go to the site in order to get an overview of an issue and want to navigate to the issue page if the overview looks interesting. This would require some simple design changes on how each issue item looks to resemble a link more.

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- Adding label filtering should be valuable to our users because I believe a lot of them go on the website in order to look for contribution opportunities and a lot of labels are related to the contribution status of an issues. For example, 'help wanted' is a common label to indicate that the maintainers welcome contribution on that issue. By implementing filtering by labels, it allows users to further customize the list to their interests.

- I think a lot of users would welcome the addition of the ability to save their favourite GitHub projects so that their issues can be more conveniently retrieved from a list of saved repositories instead of having to paste a link every time. Furthermore, if more filtering options are added in the future, this saving feature can also incorporate the custom filters so that an user can more quickly get to the issues they are interested in.

- I would love to implement a feature that displays the overall statistics, such as the total number of open issues, of a repository because that would allow an user to get an even broader snapshot for the project right away. Right now the only way to get an overall climate of a project is to skim through through the details of the latest issues which is quite a cumbersome way to quickly gauge one's level of interest in the repository. On the other hand, an overview box should satisfy that need competently.
